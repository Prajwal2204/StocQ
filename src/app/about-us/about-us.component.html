        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>Financial markets are highly complex stochastic systems,
          Thus it is much more beneficial for us to predict prices on a short term basis rather than predict what is going to happen a few hours, days or even months down the line.
          Thus we will be using Deep Q learning as it focuses on the benefit of the Q value rather than modeling the market. as it can also quickly adapt to recent market conditions thus making it less prone to market structure changes.

        <p>We have found abundant data on financial platforms such as yahoo finance and other dedicated data providers. We can also extract data from trading terminals provided they allow us  to write scripts on their platform, thus capturing very recent data and saving it to a file.
